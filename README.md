# SRP

## Update so far:
1. Dataloading and a model class has been implemented
2. Training loop has been written

## Remaining Work:
1. Some training on cluster has to be performed

## Usage:
Clone the repo or either pull it. Create a new folder with a name of datasets in the same github directory. Extract any or all 50Salads, HAPT, mHealth or GTEA dataset/s. Run the test_loading.py to load the data using the pytorch dataloader class. The batch_size and window_length can be changed from the dataloading class itself.
